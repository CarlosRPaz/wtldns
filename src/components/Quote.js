        Although My Vision Is Unique, My Heart Is Pure.

        I am aroused by a new passion for a journey with no mats, a pen, a
        paper, and a keyboard with intoxicating thoughts. I hope to thrill my
        readers; I hope to scare and bring chills to your living room couch.
        But, when it is all said and done, I hope you can live your life with a
        smile as we connect through, “When the light does not shine.”
